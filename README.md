Employee Salary Calculator

## Description

This app is used to calculate the monthly cost of an employee based of the yearly salary of each employee.

Each time a new employee is added (using the 'submit' button), it will add a new line to the table with the information provided. (All boxes must be filled in order to submit properly.)

Once added, the app will take into account the newly added salary and update the 'Total Monthly Expense' at the bottom of the table to reflect the changes made.

The 'Remove' button in the far right column will remove the entire row from the table and update the 'Total Monthly Expense' at the bottom of the table to reflect the changes made.
